Configure a Portable LTE Router üíä Create your secure connection for mobility ‚ö°Ô∏è


**In this test, we are going to test a small portable LTE Router that allows 5V power supply**.

<br>

In this router we can configure our Internet connection in different ways in addition to being able to configure a VPN service.
All this and much more with a small and quite robust device.
<br>
<br>
#Examples of uses for this router:
<br>
-Connect to the Internet with the LTE modem and establish a tunnel to a VPN service to have encrypted traffic.

-Connect as a client to an Access Point (e.g. a coffee shop or your own cell phone) and share it via ethernet cable.

-Connect to the Internet via LTE modem or Ethernet cable and generate a normal access point or even encrypted with VPN.

-Establish a connection against our home router to be able to access our equipment and avoid cg-nat in some way by being able to access the router and the connected equipment.

-Use the 'Mode' button to change peer and have a different public IP or to load different configurations.

-Use in your IoT project for testing.

-Set up as a second connection in your home so you can have a failover on your router in case of Internet loss.

#Test
<br>
<br>
For this test we are going to get a 4GB mobile data SIM from a low cost operator with an approximate cost of 2$. The ISP provides us with a public ip under CG-NAT.

It includes integrated tools to improve the LTE connection such as 'LTE Cell Monitor' and 'LTE Scanner'. You also have 'Torch', 'Traceroute', 'Wireless Snooper' among others:

You can modify the processor frequency to increase performance or decrease power consumption with all that this entails.

<br>
Notes: It has a miniPCI-e port and I would like to change the LTE module for a LoRa module to experiment ;).

Enjoy it!
